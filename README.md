# NAO-Java
These codes are made to have fun with NAO and his Java library. You should be able to control the majority of NAO features with this project. You can also control things like LEDs and postures live.

## GUI
The GUI is very raw but I will make improvements. At the moment you have 3 windows, one to open the other two, that control LEDs and postures.

## Language
This project is developed in italian, so make sure to change everything you need into your native language, included NAO's langage settings for speech synthesis and recognition.
