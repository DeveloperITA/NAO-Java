# NAO-Java
This is a fun project to control NAO via Java. The software supports extensions to improve and expand every possibility. Graphics is fully customizable: colors are editable in the themes' files, images can be changed in the same files.
Labels are easily personalizable, too: you can add countless languages and for any of them you can customize every string.
